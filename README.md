This is the Github Repository for "Intro to Game Design" CA1 Project.

Members: 
Chris Bolger, Padraic Coffey and Adam Christensen

Task:
This is a group project that will be deployed in portfolio format. To get started you need to form a group of two or three people.  This group will be your project group for the semester.  The name of your project group and names of team members need to be recorded on the Project Wiki.

You are required to design an interactive story-based game using "Risk it for a Biscuit" as your theme. 

Required:
Create a GitHub repo for your project. Use GitHub Pages to create an index page for your project's portfolio. This will eventually have several links, including pitch, brainstorm, Scrum, prototype, etc. 
Conduct a brainstorming session with your teammates. Use Trello to manage the session. Collect evidence that the session took place in the form of a video or screen grabs of your completed Trello board. Detail the who, where, when, how long, etc. of the session. The product of the session should be a coherent game concept (board or digital) that will form the basis of your game pitch. Prepare a five minute presentation to describe your game concept. Use Google Slides or PowerPoint to create your slide deck. Some background on pitching here and here. Your pitch should be recorded and posted to YouTube.
Using your knowledge of Scrum, prepare a project management plan for your game. Plan and detail the first Sprint. Provide a burndown chart for the Sprint. For forecasting purposes, assume that the final deliverable falls due in the second week of January. Use Trello to create a Scrum board.
Upload one Word document containing all of the above here. Include links to two Trello boards (brainstorm and Scrum board), your project GitHub page, your pitch video and your slides. If you have used PowerPoint upload your slides here (in .pptx format).
